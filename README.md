# â€¢ IFR+ â€¢ 
The new inline frame rerouter is here, recoded from scratch! Now designed purposely for quickly going incognito on your school chromebook on any almost any site. IFR has been upgraded now with settings, bookmarks, and even more tools! Still, it remains free &amp; open-source for all to use, contribute, and more.

Want this powerful tool for yourself? Go to the "bookmarklet.js" file and copy all the code there into your bookmarks bar, then click on that bookmark to use it! Note that IFR+ won't work on the new tab page and a couple websites.

### Disclaimer
IFR+ was made for the use of protecting the rights of privacy of us human beings. Many schools/workplaces don't allow their students/employees to clear their history, which I believe to be a basic right. Using IFR+ their history won't be saved and they can also circumvent certain tab focusing programs as an added bonus. Of course, that was in no way meant to be used during school/work hours, when people need to do their actual work well & efficiently.
