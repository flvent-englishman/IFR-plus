# IFR+
â–¸The new inline frame rerouter is here, recoded from scratch! Now designed purposely for quickly going incognito on your school chromebook on any almost any site. IFR has been upgraded now with settings, bookmarks, and even more tools! Still, it remains free &amp; open-source for all to use, contribute, and more.
